    Learning React. Following a tutorial on Youtube via JS Mastery. 
    I began by setting up react environment. I needed to install node and npm, Vite, and git. My code editor is VSCode but in the tutorial, WebStorm is being used which looks promising but will continue to use VSCode. 
    After the environment is setup then I get introduced to components, props and CSS use externally, inline and making use of Tailwind.
    I was exposed to UseState and UseEffect. I don't understand them yet but they are next to understand and grasp.
    done.
