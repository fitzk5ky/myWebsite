        <p>Learning React. Following a tutorial on Youtube via JS Mastery.</p> 
        <h3>Setup Environment</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Node + npm -> needed to JS and manage packages</li>
            <li>Vite -> build tool and server to create a React app</li>
            <li>Git -> already installed</li>
            <li>Code Editor -> I use VSCode. The guy in the tutorial uses WebStorm. I also use VSCode for work. Sticking with VSCode but may play around with WebStorm.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I was introduced to some basic React concepts that include: components, props and the various ways to style React components</p>
        <p>There was light exposure to UseState and UseEffect. Still haven't grasped what these are fully but will dig in.</p>
