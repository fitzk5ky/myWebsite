        <p>Todays main objective was to understand how to create a block in WordPress. The site at my w2 was developed by a larger company of developers and they structured with WordPress build in a peculiar way. My task is to figure out the process (they also didn't create documentation for us).</p>
        <p>First I began creating a block the way WordPress recommends <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/tutorial/">here</a>. I created a local wp on my personal website with <a href="https://localwp.com/">local wp</a>. From there I followed the steps and after some time the block was created</p>
        <p>Unfortunetly the codebase for my w2 is a different beast BUT I did figure it out and I created a block at 4:50pm. I spend all afternoon figuring out where the files are, what files should be edited, what files should be created/added. I got stuck with having to update node and npm a few times, not sure why. I had to deal with some errors in function.php which I think came about because I was running <code>npm run build</code> in the wrong folders.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, I feel accomplished with figuring it out. Tomorrow brings about a new beast of documenting what I did. I plan to take another stab creating a block from scratch again. I'm going to use the tutorial above from WordPress and see if I can cut down on time as well as errors</p>
        <p>Before the day concludes I still have some React work to tap in to. I used Claude to put together 2 week bootcamp of React for me and Claude provided me a nice bootcamp and I have to do a code challenge for day 1. I also found out Codeacademy has a React course so I will work through a bit before shutting the studio down</p>
