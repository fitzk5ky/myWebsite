<body>
    Studying for the GitHub Foundational Certification with modules that Microsoft provides. It's mainly text based material. I needed to get this site up on GitHub so ... 2 birds 1 stone ya know.
    I "had" to install homebrew, install git. Git version was stuck on 2.20.1 but the website says Git is up to 2.49.1.
