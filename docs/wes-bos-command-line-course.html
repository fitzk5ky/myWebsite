        <p>I completed a quick command line course provided by <a href="https://wesbos.com/courses">Wes Bos</a>. It was a fun course on iTerm2, zsh shell and some cool themes and plugins to implement to make working with the command line a lot better. I'm nerding out because I elevated my terminal and it looks so cooler now and makes me excited to code. I also learned a handful of useful commands for terminal. I feel more confident navigating through folders and files now.</p>
        <p>Soemthing cool I picked up with how to open a file in VSCode through the terminal with code "filename". And if you get the command not found error in terminal then just go into VSCode and hit cmd + shift + p. Then enter shell and click to install. Then you're be able to use the code command.</p>
